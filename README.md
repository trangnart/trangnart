- 👩🏻‍💻 My name is Trang Tran, but you can call me **Jane** — it’s much easier to pronounce!

- 🎓 I graduated *Cum Laude* in Computer Science from UCSC in the Class of 2024. Go Banana Slugs!

- 🔎 I’m on the hunt for a ```SWE role``` that involves innovative, high-impact projects with room for professional growth and development. If you know of any openings, ping me 🥺

- 👾 Besides coding, I play Nintendo—I'm terrible at it. Let's play together and see if you can dethrone the reigning champion of fails!

- 🦎 Fun fact: You might not guess it from looking at me, but I have a superpower: I can zap about reptiles for hours! I’ve adopted a veiled chameleon and a crested gecko, and they’re the COOLEST pets ever. I’m a newbie nerd when it comes to building terrarium ecosystem tanks. My ultimate dream? Building a fabulous ecosystem greenhouse in my garden for my scaly kiddos!!!
