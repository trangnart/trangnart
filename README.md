## Unlocking the Coder's Quest: A Geek's Guide into My Friend Circle 👋

- 👩🏻‍💻 My name is Trang Tran, but you can call me **Jane** — it’s much easier to pronounce!
- 🎓 I graduated *Cum Laude* in Computer Science from UCSC in the Class of 2024. Go Banana Slugs!
- 🔎 I’m on the hunt for a ```SWE role``` that involves innovative, high-impact projects with room for professional growth and development. If you know of any openings, ping me 🥺
- 👾 When I'm not buried in code, you'll find me slaying in Nintendo games and a moment-capturing enthusiast. So if you ever need a photo op during a Mario Kart race, I’m your go-to person hehe.
- 🦎 Fun fact: You might not guess it from looking at me, but I have a superpower: I can zap about reptiles for hours! I’ve adopted a veiled chameleon and a crested gecko, and they’re the COOLEST pets ever. My ultimate dream? Building a fabulous ecosystem greenhouse in my garden for my scaly kiddos!!!
